__What is html2apk?__

html2apk is a free service that lets you wrap a website into a slim (~25K) android app.

__Is it free?__

Yap, I've just said that.

__Whats in the generated app?__

Just a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) displaying your site. nothing more.

__How do I install the generated app on my device?__

You will need to enable the _allow installation of apps from sources other than Google Play store_ setting. See [how to install apk from the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+install+apk+from+the+internet&atb=v138-3__&ia=web) for more information.

__How do I publish the generated app on Google Play?__

You will need to create a Google Play developer account, then upload the generated app and follow the steps at the Google Play console. See [How do I publish app on Google Play?](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=How+do+I+publish+app+on+Google+Play%3F&atb=v138-3__&ia=web) for more information.

__I have a suggestion__

I will love to [hear about it](https://github.com/html2apk/html2apk/issues)
